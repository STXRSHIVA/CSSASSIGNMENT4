CSS Flexbox:

                        One-dimensional Layout:
            => Direction: Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional layouts, either in a row or a column.
            => Main Axis and Cross Axis: It has a main axis and a cross axis, and items are laid out along the main axis.

                        Content-Driven Layout:
            => Flexible Sizing: It's particularly useful when dealing with items of different sizes, and it adjusts the size of items based on their content.

                        Ideal for Components:
            => Components: Flexbox is well-suited for laying out smaller-scale components, such as navigation bars, buttons, and other UI elements.


            CSS Grid:

                        Two-dimensional Layout:
            => Rows and Columns: Grid is designed for two-dimensional layouts with rows and columns, providing more control over both dimensions simultaneously.
            => Grid Lines and Tracks: You can define explicit rows and columns and create grid lines and tracks for precise placement.
                        
                        Fixed or Flexible Layout:
            => Control Over Size: Grid provides more control over the sizing of both rows and columns, allowing for fixed or flexible layouts.
                        
                        Ideal for Page Structure:
            => Overall Page Structure: Grid is often used for larger-scale layouts, defining the overall structure of a webpage.

When to Choose One Over the Other:
            
            Use Flexbox When:
            => You need to arrange items in a single dimension (row or column).
            => The layout is more content-driven, and you want items to grow or shrink based on their content.
            => You are dealing with smaller-scale components within a larger layout.
            Example:


            .flex-container {
            display: flex;
            justify-content: space-between;
            }

Use Grid When:

            You need a two-dimensional layout with both rows and columns.
            You want precise control over the placement of items in both directions.
            You are designing the overall page structure with a combination of rows and columns.
            Example:


            .grid-container {
            display: grid;
            grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
            grid-gap: 10px;
            }

            In practice, you might find that a combination of both Flexbox and Grid is often the most effective approach, with Flexbox handling the layout of individual components and Grid handling the overall page structure. The choice depends on the specific layout requirements of your project.
