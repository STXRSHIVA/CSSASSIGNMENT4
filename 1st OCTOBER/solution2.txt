justify-content:

        => Role: This property defines how the items inside a flex container are distributed along the main axis.
        => Values:
            flex-start: Items are packed at the start of the main axis.
            flex-end: Items are packed at the end of the main axis.
            center: Items are centered along the main axis.
            space-between: Items are evenly distributed with the first item at the start and the last item at the end.                
            space-around: Items are evenly distributed with equal space around them.
            space-evenly: Items are evenly distributed with equal space around them, including before the first and after the last item.

            Example

            .flex-container {
            display: flex;
            justify-content: space-between;
            }

align-items:

        => Role: This property defines how the items inside a flex container are aligned along the cross axis.
        => Values:
            flex-start: Items are aligned at the start of the cross axis.
            flex-end: Items are aligned at the end of the cross axis.
            center: Items are centered along the cross axis.
            baseline: Items are aligned based on their baselines.
            stretch: Items are stretched to fill the container along the cross axis.

            Example

            .flex-container {
            display: flex;
            align-items: center;
            }

gap:
        
        => Role: This property defines the spacing between flex items within a flex container.
        => Values: Any length unit, such as pixels, ems, or percentages.

            Example

            .flex-container {
            display: flex;
            gap: 10px;
            }

flex-direction:

        => Role: This property defines the direction of the main axis in the flex container.
        => Values:
            row: Main axis is the same as the writing mode (horizontal).
            row-reverse: Main axis is the same as the writing mode, but reversed.
            column: Main axis is perpendicular to the writing mode (vertical).
            column-reverse: Main axis is perpendicular to the writing mode, but reversed.

            Example

            .flex-container {
            display: flex;
            flex-direction: column;
            }

flex-wrap:

        => Role: This property defines whether flex items should wrap to a new line if they overflow the container along the main axis.
        => Values:
            nowrap: All flex items are on one line (default).
            wrap: Flex items wrap onto multiple lines as necessary.
            wrap-reverse: Flex items wrap onto multiple lines in reverse order.

            Example

            .flex-container {
            display: flex;
            flex-wrap: wrap;
            }
